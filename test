Remember to check that the insurance on your property has adequate cover, as your mortgage terms require you to fully insure the property. Find out more at the Australian Securities and Investments Commission website: moneysmart.gov.au. If you have a strata title, you may be covered by body corporate insurance. To talk through your specific insurance needs, contact your insurer or body corporate.

It's important to pay on time as this appears on your consumer credit report as part of comprehensive credit reporting (CCR). CCR provides a more complete picture of your credit history including on time and late repayments. You can also see your consumer credit account open and closed dates, type of credit, credit limit and whether you are in a financial hardship arrangement. For more information, see our website, our Privacy Statement or visit CreditSmart.org.au.
