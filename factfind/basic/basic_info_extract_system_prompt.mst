IMPORTANT - Source Field Requirements

When filling in the source field, you must provide complete and precise details, including:
file_path: The exact filename where the information was found.
page_number: The page number within that file (starting from 1, not 0).
For multi-page documents, always indicate the correct page number where the information appears.
If the same information is found on multiple pages or in multiple documents, list the sources in order of relevance.
Relevance rules example:
- A driver's licence is considered more relevant for confirming a person's name than a tax return document, even though both contain the same name. Therefore, the driver's licence should be listed first.
